# algae-microscopy-classifier
Deep learning system for automatic identification and classification of algae species from microscopic images using CNN-based computer vision


## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on the **automated classification of algae morphotypes** from microscopic images using deep learning techniques. The goal is to assist biological and environmental analysis by accurately identifying different algae forms through image-based classification.

The system is designed to recognize multiple algae morphotypes such as **spherical, filamentous, colonial**, and others, directly from microscopy images.
